		<font color="black"><hr><p1 style="font-size:170%;"><p style="text-indent:40px">Humans are unquestionably superior to all other organisms on the planet. When I write a few lines or words about myself to introduce myself, I feel like I'm a small part of this vast universe of people. I am a person. I consider myself to be humble, compassionate, kind, and brave. I am a responsible individual. Though writing about yourself is difficult, I will do my best to communicate a little bit about myself.</p></p1>
		
		<p2 style="font-size:170%;"><p style="text-indent:40px">Good day, everyone. Hello. I am Angelica Brenio Cabana, a simple and responsible daughter of Mr. Romeo H. Cabaña Sr., a farmer, and Mrs. May May Ann B. Cabaña, a housekeeper. I am 22 years old and currently reside in the Barangay of San Pascual in the town of Burgos in the province of Pangasinan. I was born on October 12, 1999, in the same town where I now live.I have two brothers, namely Angelo and Romeo Cabaña Jr. We have had a cousin living with us since she was three years old, and she is the child I look after. When it comes to my interests and what I like to do, I enjoy cooking because it was a daily chore in our house, and I enjoy watching TV, movies, and other life-related films.</p></p2>
		
		<p3 style="font-size:170%;"><p style="text-indent:40px">In terms of my academic career, I studied <a href="https://m.facebook.com/Burgoscs1011401/">Burgos Central Elementary School</a> in Poblacion, Burgos, Pangasinan, where I completed my elementary school. When I was younger, I preferred to play games outside, even if it was hot, and I had no worries about it. I used to play men's games like shotgun and yo-yo back then. My thinking matured as I grew up in my adult period and till I entered high school. I finished my secondary level, junior and senior high school education at <a href="https://m.facebook.com/300179BURGOSNHS/">Burgos National High School</a> located in Poblacion, Burgos, Pangasinan. I went through a lot during that time. That's where I was bullied, but it wasn't all that bad. I also had a lot of friends and acquaintances at the time. I also had crushing liking and loving the wrong person. Regardless of what happened, I had to complete high school, and as a result, I graduated with honors in grades 11 and 12, as well as a medal and certificate for having the best research group. Now, I am in my fourth year of college at <a href="https://psu.edu.ph/">Pangasinan State University</a>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a major in Computer Information Technology (CIT). In addition, I was on the Dean's List twice. And now I'm only five months away from graduating. I don't want to blow this chance and I don't want to squander this opportunity to complete my education. Just a little bit more, and I'll be able to achieve my dreams for me and for my family, because from the beginning until the end, my family is my inspiration. Thank you for taking time to read about my little description of myself. I hope you have a good time with it.<span>&#9786;</span></p></p3><hr>
